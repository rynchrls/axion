                        The result of **1 plus 1** is **2**. In standard arithmetic, this is a fundamental operation where adding 1 to itself yields 2.

                        If you're looking for a more detailed explanation, here's how it works:
                        - **1** is a number.
                        - Adding another **1** to it means combining the two quantities: **1 + 1 = 2**.

                        This is the same in all standard number systems (e.g., decimal, binary, hexadecimal) unless explicitly stated otherwise. Let me know if you'd like to explore variations in different contexts! ðŸ˜Š""",
